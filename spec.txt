Todo:
1. make a simple web server
2. implement an access point for the clients to attach to (tcp)
3. make functionality for uploading a single file
4. create a way for the client to download that file
5. make uploading multiple files possible
6. enable the client to browse through the files on the server
7. make downloading multiple files possible
8. make the server multithreaded so that many clients can connect at the same time
8.2. implement some kind of authorization
9. make the downloads parallel
10. make the uploads faster (maybe paralell from the client using separate tcp connections like copyparty)
11. make error corrections for each file chunk that is uploaded to the server (probably using checksums)
12. implement file deduplication (when a file that is already on the server is uploaded just creata symlink to an existing file)
13. make the uploads resetable (when the connnection fails in the middle of uploading/downloading just resume asap)
14. make synchronising the files an option (when there is a change in client files you can synchronise)
15. add support for sharing files with other servers
16. add support for sharing files with a special link
17. add configuration for the server (so that maybe everyone can download but they can't change or move anything)
